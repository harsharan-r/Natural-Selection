# Natural-Selection

First Natural Selection program, in which a dot is generationally trained to find the goal. Also can move around basic obstacles which can be enabled and disabled through the code. To make this project I rewrote Code Bullet's Java Tutorial for AI in Python using numpy, pandas and pygame.
