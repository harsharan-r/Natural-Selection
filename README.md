# Natural Selection

This is my first natural selection program, in which a dot is generationally trained to find the goal. Also can move around basic obstacles which can be enabled and disabled through the code. To make this project I rewrote Code Bullet's Java Tutorial for AI in Python using numpy, pandas, and pygame. This code was writen before I added version control so my iterations exist as folders in the app directory. Please check out the `NatSelect Game 3 (Working)` for the working copy.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/harsharan-r/Natural-Selection.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies if any (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Game
Navigate to the `NatSelect Game 3 (Working)` folder:
```
cd Natural-Selection/First\ Natural\ Selection/NatSelect\ Game\ 3\ \(Working\)
```

To run the simulation, execute the following in your terminal:

```
python Main.py
```
